Central Logging - SCP, Guardrails


AC1: SCP terraform code created and deployed to ensure logs cannot be disabled, deleted or tampered with. 

AC2: Determine which Control Tower Guardrails are needed for central logging.

AC3 : conditional deny rule - specific role can override.

TSS and NIST controls that relate to the Centralized audit logging documented and configurations identified in code to make resources compliant. Links to bank std retention policy for logs. Enforce retention in configuration (s3 bucket lifecycle policy has maximum retention period move the logs into glacier / Infrequent Access - follow industry best practice).

Deny Log Modification Policy
This policy is designed to prevent the modification, disabling, deletion, or tampering of logs within the AWS CloudWatch Logs service. It achieves this by denying specific actions on log-related resources, ensuring the integrity and availability of logs. This policy is attached to an AWS Organizations service control policy (SCP) and applied to specific organizational units.

Explanation
The aws_iam_policy_document data block defines the JSON policy document that specifies the actions, resources, and conditions for denying log modification.
The aws_organizations_policy resource block creates an SCP named "DenyLogModificationSCP" that uses the policy document defined in data.aws_iam_policy_document.deny_log_modification.
The aws_organizations_policy_attachment resource block attaches the policy to a specific organizational unit identified by target_id.
This policy ensures that log-related actions are denied unless the request includes a tag named "AllowLogModification" with a value of "true".

Please replace the placeholders (e.g., "[Contents of the policy document]") with actual policy content and related values.
